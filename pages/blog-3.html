          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Acoustic guitar is such an expressive instrument, and miking it to capture all of the nuances is incredibly
            satisfying. I have a few methods of recording acoustic guitar that I'm happy to share. Let me preface this
            by saying that the importance of having a well-maintained guitar that is played well can't be overstated.

          <h2>Crafting the right sound on acoustic guitar?</h2>
          <p>
            It's completely dependent on the role of the acoustic guitar in the track. If the acoustic guitar is the
            focus and feature of the song, panned down the middle like a lead vocal or solo instrument, small-diaphragm
            mics tend to work better for me. I typically want a very detailed, upfront sound, so I start with the mic
            pointed at about the 12th to 15th fret. Then, in addition to the close mic, I'll add a pair of omni mics set
            up in a triangle configuration, left and right equidistant from the close mic to give me distance and
            ambience. That gives the guitar a three-dimensional sound. I like to use DPA mics with the acoustic pressure
            equalizer balls that focus the high end a bit more. The distance between the stereo mics and the guitar
            depends on the room, the instrument, the part. Usually they are 18″ 24″ away, unless it's a super-gentle
            part where I might need to bring them in closer. The close mic is probably only 2″ 4″ away from the strings
            — really close, unless it's a big, strummy part.

          <h2>The location of the microphone</h2>
          <p>
            A lot of times in the track the acoustic guitar is performing the function of a percussion instrument, like
            a tuned shaker. If I'm going for a stereo percussive effect, with lots of pick and not a lot of body, the
            placement of the microphone is absolutely crucial. The closer you get to the soundhole, the more woof and
            low end you'll pick up. Put a small-diaphragm condenser mic right on the soundhole, and you'll be
            overwhelmed with low end. If your mic is poorly placed, the mic choice is almost inconsequential.
            <br><br>
            I really like to hear notes from the acoustic. I'd rather have tone than just percussion. I'm not a huge fan
            of bright mics on acoustics — anything that pings my ear at 6kHz or so. I just don't want that competing
            with my cymbals and other instruments. I'd rather have the guitar be more midrange, more “note” than
            “scratch.”
            <br><br>
            The key to me is the song. If the song is super strummy and I'm going to double it, then tailoring the low
            end is crucial. I think acoustic guitars tend to rock really hard. Some people don't understand how much
            acoustics can rock. Look back at rockabilly or any music before electric guitars were really a feature, like
            back to Pete Townshend and the Who. For that, a large-diaphragm condenser mic moved farther away from the
            instrument might be the perfect sound, with a little more of the room in play.
